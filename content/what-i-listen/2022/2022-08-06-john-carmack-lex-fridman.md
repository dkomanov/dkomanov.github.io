I don't have much to say about this podcast, apart from the fact that it was 5 hours of pure joy to listen a deep and detailed conversation about programming :) The [episode](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6kOa4mSuZcIOEPaGmDZf9r) on Joe Rogan was also good, but, as always, here it's deeper and more interesting for me.

- Trade offs are everything on any cutting edge (space, programming etc), it's very important to understand what you lose when you gain something.
- And this is a very important ability to be able to find a thing to workaround to gain a lot and advance. A lot of examples in the podcast. Doom was 2.5D game, it's wasn't true 3D, but it felt like it, and it matters more, because it advanced the industry.
- Also I fully agree with John about working more: you are going to achieve more by working more.
