Overall, this conversation is interesting, but not too much. I compared it internally with the conversation with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60KJz1BVTyU\">Jack Dorsey</a>, which I like much more :)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A very good <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7o5SlBsS6c\">intro speech</a> about Russia’s invasion. Touching.</li>\n<li>Whispering during the meeting (!) in VR. That’s nice.</li>\n<li>In VR it’s enough to show only hands, without arms, because if virtual arm won’t mimic exact position, it’s very discomforting, but just hands is good enough for immersive experience.</li>\n<li>Identity and security conversations were weak. Not really insightful: many identities, how to make sure you is you etc.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/\">Social Dilemma</a> arguments are a little bit more compelling to me. But there’s a lot of truth in Mark’s words, that there’s a leap of faith that increase of engagement (and making people angrier) is actually that important for the company in the long run. Also, the argument that there are studies that says that polarization’s source isn’t in social medias. I’m wondering, where the science will come to some consensus there.</li>\n<li>As a public figure, it’s hard to say how it’s different if 25% of people dislike you, or 75% of people dislike you. That’s an interesting point.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/05/technology/teenage-girls-instagram.html\">Instagram and teenage mental health</a>… I don’t know much about this topic. Basically, Mark’s reply is that media misrepresented the story: they focused on one aspect of the study to which FB tried to make some changes, instead of overall goodness of the fact that FB does such studies and makes attempts to improve its product.</li>\n<li>On freedom of speech. The argument for censorship is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shouting_fire_in_a_crowded_theater\">you can’t yell Fire in the theater</a>, so, basically, in case of covid this is the rule of thumb.

In a way, that the atmosphere of the conspiracy theories is too think, so need to listen with higher awareness. Which is always good, actually.</li>\n<li>Food intelligence. <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Datawatch/China-hoards-over-half-the-world-s-grain-pushing-up-global-prices\">China hoards</a> a lot of grain and stuff. Food security and stuff. Also, meat producers going to fake meats, because it’s cheaper. Don’t have passion to verify, but generally food industry is fucked up, it’s for sure: fucking ketchup has too much sugar in it.</li>\n<li>Nice discussion about the state of the medicine: doctors are more like factory workers with a huge incentive to give you a pill, instead of investigation of what is wrong in general, what’s need to be changed in the lifestyle etc. My guess is that we (people) should have more agency here. Doctors are to fix problems which average person can’t. We all know what’s wrong with our lifestyles, it’s our “choice” to continue bad habits.</li>\n<li>Joe reiterated very disturbing podcast with <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/6pLW2tMx4Kw5qaeAcxj0Lj\">Dr. Shanna Swan</a> about influence of the plastic on mammals and humans.</li>\n<li>Yet another conversation about decentralization. It’s the thing for Adam Curry, which I personally admire. Jack Dorsey allegedly does something on a side (even before resignation from Twitter). The <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/60pgpGgZmGuQ0E4ho0L99c\">first conversation</a> with Jack Dorsey was heavily criticized, but I really enjoyed it, because it was a good interview and I like insights in a thought process of Jack. He is a cool guy.</li>\n<li>Kazakhstan. Adam’s conspiracy theory that US did Ukraine’s revolution in 2013/2014 (OMG!) and now they did it in Kazakhstan. American exceptionalism in action :) Sometimes stuff just happens. But I didn’t dive into this entire situation - no time.</li>\n<li>Good thought that there’s no Kennedy now in politics. No one with good ideas, against confrontation, against “military industrial complex” etc. Maybe it’s true. Or maybe it’s just our perception and everything is just more complicated. Way too complicated.</li>\n<li>Yet another conspiracy about bankers that lent trillions just before pandemic and they needed a way to put money to the population and pandemic actually helped with that. OMG. I don’t know, maybe, but I want someone more professional and with more digging on that.</li>\n<li>Liked the term “meet space” with regards to meta-verse.</li>\n<li>Wow, Adam is licensed pilot (helicopters).</li>\n<li>Nuclear + natural gas. Batteries problems. Austin electricity problem and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron\">Enron</a> all over again.</li>\n<li>Adam was in college for 3 months and Joe for 3 years part time.</li>\n<li>Adam told some strange story, that people were lobotomized (willingly, payed for it) in Central Park, NY. Quick google search didn’t confirm. What’s true though, that it was very common practice in 1950-70, and one clinic on Long Island conducted like 4% of all lobotomies in US at some point.</li>\n<li>Discussed heroine-like drugs! Joe cited some of <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/4xMbq7gLEjFioOQ5gpSw2l\">Dr. Carl Hart</a> about withdrawal from heroine is like flu.</li>\n<li>Medication of the children.
