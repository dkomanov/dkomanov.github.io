- _2022-02-18_ [Humanityâ€™s greatest political achievement has been the decline of war. That is now in jeopardy](https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2022/02/09/yuval-noah-harari-argues-that-whats-at-stake-in-ukraine-is-the-direction-of-human-history).
  Yuval Noah Harari is a very interesting guy, his view on the history of mankind is amazing (I read couple of his books). In this article he argues that proponents of War between Russia and Ukraine want to pull us (as a humanity) back to the jungle, from where we escaped just recently. Can't agree more.
