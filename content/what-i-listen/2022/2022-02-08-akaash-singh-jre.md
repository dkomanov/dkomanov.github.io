- First thing first. This is the first episode after the "controversy" with N-word video. Joe did an apology, but then he moved on - doesn't spend time online to be sane, so, the avalanche doesn't hit him.
- The new special [Bring Back Apu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk3svL0GPWI) of Akaash is amazing. It is about political correctness, overcorrection etc. On point.
