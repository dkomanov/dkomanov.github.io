* _2019-12-29_ [Sabbatical check-in. Reflecting on 8 months of full-time self-study](https://www.jotaen.net/2e2Ff/sabbatical-self-study-reflection/).
Taking a long-long sabbatical is kind of a dream for me. It's interesting how people spend their time.
* _2019-12-30_ [Programmers Should Plan For Lower Pay](https://www.jefftk.com/p/programmers-should-plan-for-lower-pay) 
Why do we get as much as we get? And should we plan for getting less? I don't know, I remember I was thinking about it ~10 years ago.

I had kind of anxiety or even imposter syndrom at that point of time. Since then I don't really reflect on this particular
subject, mostly because I feel why and also because other aspects of software engineering is interesting to me (apart from
programming itself): what is the best application for my skillset for both myself and society; which jobs are "no go" and "not good" for society; when is it time to go develop stuff around health/democracy/other important stuff to me?
