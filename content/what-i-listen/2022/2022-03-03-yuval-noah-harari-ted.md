- Ukraine has a very long history of being an independent state.
- Ukrainians aren't Russians.
- Putin has a fantasy (literally his words, I agree, of course) of Ukraine as not only part of Russia, but also as non-existent nation, which is obviously false (inconsistent with the reality as a lot of Putin's views).
- All that Putin will be able to achieve in this war is to plant seeds of hatred towards Russians for generations to come.
- Yuval mentioned Kenyan Ambassador [speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf0gb0sQI40), impressed by the level of understanding of the world.
- In Israel people that came from USSR were labeled as Russians (regardless of ethnicity), but now people start to differentiate themselves...
