Lex is more on a side of the West. But can’t deny that West is not all fluffy, the number of deaths and people’s displacement caused by USA is huge (Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen etc). But at the end ideals of the West are clearly better, but it would be better to stand up to those ideals.</li>\n<li>Aliens :D Actually, I’m with Lex, I think there are aliens, I don’t think life is that unique.</li>\n<li>About censorship: Lex claims that it’s important to understand why are there flat-earthers, what is behind. Is it disbelief of science or something else? Basically, that there’s an issue that manifests in something that other people want to just censor, which doesn’t solve the problem.</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"date":"2022-05-27T00:00:00.000Z","title":"JRE #1824 - Lex Fridman","podcastDate":"2022-05-26T00:00:00.000Z","url":"https://open.spotify.com/episode/7f7MM2aHEoRHie7i7MI7A2","teaser":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fixed","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/c499f0ec617662bfc47dc91c6628507f/e07e1/2022-05-27-lex-fridman-jre.jpg","srcSet":"/static/c499f0ec617662bfc47dc91c6628507f/e07e1/2022-05-27-lex-fridman-jre.jpg 100w,\n/static/c499f0ec617662bfc47dc91c6628507f/dd515/2022-05-27-lex-fridman-jre.jpg 200w","sizes":"100px"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/c499f0ec617662bfc47dc91c6628507f/d8057/2022-05-27-lex-fridman-jre.webp 100w,\n/static/c499f0ec617662bfc47dc91c6628507f/2e34e/2022-05-27-lex-fridman-jre.webp 200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100px"}]},"width":100,"height":100}}},"tags":["lex fridman","jre"],"draft":null},"fields":{"slug":"/what-i-listen/2022-05-27-lex-fridman-jre"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3675711862"]}
