Overall, this conversation is interesting, but not too much. I compared it internally with the conversation with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60KJz1BVTyU\">Jack Dorsey</a>, which I like much more :)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A very good <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7o5SlBsS6c\">intro speech</a> about Russia’s invasion. Touching.</li>\n<li>Whispering during the meeting (!) in VR. That’s nice.</li>\n<li>In VR it’s enough to show only hands, without arms, because if virtual arm won’t mimic exact position, it’s very discomforting, but just hands is good enough for immersive experience.</li>\n<li>Identity and security conversations were weak. Not really insightful: many identities, how to make sure you is you etc.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/\">Social Dilemma</a> arguments are a little bit more compelling to me. But there’s a lot of truth in Mark’s words, that there’s a leap of faith that increase of engagement (and making people angrier) is actually that important for the company in the long run. Also, the argument that there are studies that says that polarization’s source isn’t in social medias. I’m wondering, where the science will come to some consensus there.</li>\n<li>As a public figure, it’s hard to say how it’s different if 25% of people dislike you, or 75% of people dislike you. That’s an interesting point.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/05/technology/teenage-girls-instagram.html\">Instagram and teenage mental health</a>… I don’t know much about this topic. Basically, Mark’s reply is that media misrepresented the story: they focused on one aspect of the study to which FB tried to make some changes, instead of overall goodness of the fact that FB does such studies and makes attempts to improve its product.</li>\n<li>On freedom of speech. The argument for censorship is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shouting_fire_in_a_crowded_theater\">you can’t yell Fire in the theater</a>, so, basically, in case of covid this is the rule of thumb. I don’t buy it.

I guess, it’s just my bias, I am a bit more in the topic.
