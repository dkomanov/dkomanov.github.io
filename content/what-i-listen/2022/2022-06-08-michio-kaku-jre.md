- A huge portion of the episode was dedicated to UFO and aliens. 100% agree with Michio Kaku that aliens exist (probability is too big). Also it's very nice that credible scientists explore the possibility of sighting, investigate the existing evidence and so on.
- [3 types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale) of civilizations.
- There was a mention of a [speculation](https://www.sciencealert.com/researchers-just-found-a-second-dyson-sphere-star) (hypothesis) that a type-2 civilization was found: a star dimmed 20%, and the speculation that there's a dyson sphere circling around it.
- Interesting things about animals. For example, ants exchange certain chemicals and those can create around 100 words, which is enough to create ants society. IIUC, such modeling was done successfully.
- Dolphin's language is still not cracked :(
- Beautiful explanation of a string theory.
