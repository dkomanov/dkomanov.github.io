Joe again reiterated what he been saying before, with the emphasis on one thing: for him it should be clear, that trans-women is trans, not hidden, and then women fighters will decide for themselves whether they want to compete against or not. In other sports it’s much more complicated as other athletes don’t have a choice (like in swimming).</li>\n<li>Vaccines and treatments. Joe not against vaccines, but questions why early treatments are being shut down (something about artificial decrease in availability in US). And, of course, ivermectin (I don’t want to repeat, it’s too unclear topic, I <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dkomanov/status/1433507403362881538\">tweeted</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dkomanov/status/1410364729634213893\">about it</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dkomanov/status/1421955362815627265\">few times</a>).</li>\n<li>Tim Dillon: Sputnik is the best vaccine, Joe: It’s good.

He stopped being afraid of cencorship from the Youtube when he moved to Spotify. At the beginning viewership decreased two time, but after one year it increased compared to what was before Spotify. So, business is good.</li>\n<li>And about Fauci and his <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/07/22/what-the-fight-between-anthony-fauci-and-rand-paul-is-really-about/\">gain of function</a> research.

In a way, that the atmosphere of the conspiracy theories is too think, so need to listen with higher awareness.

Don’t have passion to verify, but generally food industry is fucked up, it’s for sure: fucking ketchup has too much sugar in it.</li>\n<li>Nice discussion about the state of the medicine: doctors are more like factory workers with a huge incentive to give you a pill, instead of investigation of what is wrong in general, what’s need to be changed in the lifestyle etc. My guess is that we (people) should have more agency here. Doctors are to fix problems which average person can’t. We all know what’s wrong with our lifestyles, it’s our “choice” to continue bad habits.</li>\n<li>Joe reiterated very disturbing podcast with <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/6pLW2tMx4Kw5qaeAcxj0Lj\">Dr. Shanna Swan</a> about influence of the plastic on mammals and humans.</li>\n<li>Yet another conversation about decentralization. It’s the thing for Adam Curry, which I personally admire. Jack Dorsey allegedly does something on a side (even before resignation from Twitter). The <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/60pgpGgZmGuQ0E4ho0L99c\">first conversation</a> with Jack Dorsey was heavily criticized, but I really enjoyed it, because it was a good interview and I like insights in a thought process of Jack. He is a cool guy.</li>\n<li>Kazakhstan. Adam’s conspiracy theory that US did Ukraine’s revolution in 2013/2014 (OMG!) and now they did it in Kazakhstan. American exceptionalism in action :) Sometimes stuff just happens. But I didn’t dive into this entire situation - no time.</li>\n<li>Good thought that there’s no Kennedy now in politics. No one with good ideas, against confrontation, against “military industrial complex” etc. Maybe it’s true. Or maybe it’s just our perception and everything is just more complicated. Way too complicated.</li>\n<li>Yet another conspiracy about bankers that lent trillions just before pandemic and they needed a way to put money to the population and pandemic actually helped with that. OMG. I don’t know, maybe, but I want someone more professional and with more digging on that.</li>\n<li>Liked the term “meet space” with regards to meta-verse.</li>\n<li>Wow, Adam is licensed pilot (helicopters).</li>\n<li>Nuclear + natural gas. Batteries problems. Austin electricity problem and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron\">Enron</a> all over again.</li>\n<li>Adam was in college for 3 months and Joe for 3 years part time.</li>\n<li>Adam told some strange story, that people were lobotomized (willingly, payed for it) in Central Park, NY. Quick google search didn’t confirm. What’s true though, that it was very common practice in 1950-70, and one clinic on Long Island conducted like 4% of all lobotomies in US at some point.</li>\n<li>Discussed heroine-like drugs! Joe cited some of <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/4xMbq7gLEjFioOQ5gpSw2l\">Dr. Carl Hart</a> about withdrawal from heroine is like flu.</li>\n<li>Medication of the children.
