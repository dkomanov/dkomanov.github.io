- I watched the [previous](https://open.spotify.com/episode/19tbM1zqjc6KjcRbzMwihN) episode, but I don't remember and (because) I didn't make notes. I just vaguely remember that I liked it :)
- We may not be over with Omicron, because there is no rule that the new variant will be milder.
- Lab leak hypothesis isn't proven ("no evidence").
- But Michael is open to the evidence.
- Interesting (from statistics): people who got Delta and had been previously infected with Alpha, suffered less than people who've been vaccinated. But! With Omicron it's the opposite: vaccine helped more than previous illness (~46:30).
- Long COVID is the next frontier for researchers.
- We need to prepare for the possibility of a new variant and new outbreak.
  > I hope it's the last one. But hope is not a strategy.
- Vitamin D influence is still under-researched. And cause is unknown.
- He is for the mandatory vaccination for medical workers, because it's not only protects them, but also patients, because (there will be studies published) vaccination reduces contraction rate and therefore spreading (no numbers at hand).
- mRNA vaccines are better at start, but J&J lasts longer. There is a possibility of having hybrid vaccination: 1 dose of J&J, one does of mRNA.
- There is a research for mRNA vaccines against cancer.
- Cloth masks and surgical masks don't work.
- A lot of stuff is still unknown :)
