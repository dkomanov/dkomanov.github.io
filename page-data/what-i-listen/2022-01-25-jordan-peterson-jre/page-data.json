Didn’t like his rhetoric about “climate is everything”, “environment is everything”. It’s true that models are simplified view of the world (if we could solve problems without models - we would), but it may be very effective. Criticism of the particular model is completely fine, but dismissing it on a basis that it doesn’t include everything - ridiculous.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Music, dance and meaning of life: music based on patterns, and in the world there are patterns all around, so music is the representation of the real world. And the quote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And birds dance, it’s not just human beings, you know. So this is a deep thing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What is interesting about this quote - what to consider deep - thinking (high level cognitive operation) or genetics/instincts?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Bible is the precondition for the manifestation of truth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>An interesting conversation about the Bible being the root of the Western Civilization, because all written work refers to it (yet another hierarchy).</li>\n<li>TIL Guy Ritchie makes <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-10009341/Would-pay-50-000-BBQ-Guy-Ritchie-debuts-fire-table-Chelsea-Flower-Show.html\">barbecue</a>, actual fire table. To bring people together in circle around the fire. Nice :)</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is no difference between writing and thinking. And there is no difference between thinking and not failing. So, you let your thoughts die instead of you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Discussion about school shooters, their darkness etc.</li>\n<li>And of course, about how left is crazy :)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Epic 4 hours. Takes on stories from Bible are interesting, but don’t touch me emotionally. Only as an intellectual endeavor.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2022-01-25T00:00:00.000Z","title":"#1769 - Jordan Peterson","podcastDate":"2022-01-25T00:00:00.000Z","url":"https://open.spotify.com/episode/7IVFm4085auRaIHS7N1NQl","teaser":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fixed","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/294a36140ad9b815a1d929fe689be861/e07e1/2022-01-25-jordan-peterson-jre.jpg","srcSet":"/static/294a36140ad9b815a1d929fe689be861/e07e1/2022-01-25-jordan-peterson-jre.jpg 100w,\n/static/294a36140ad9b815a1d929fe689be861/dd515/2022-01-25-jordan-peterson-jre.jpg 200w","sizes":"100px"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/294a36140ad9b815a1d929fe689be861/d8057/2022-01-25-jordan-peterson-jre.webp 100w,\n/static/294a36140ad9b815a1d929fe689be861/2e34e/2022-01-25-jordan-peterson-jre.webp 200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100px"}]},"width":100,"height":100}}},"tags":["jordan peterson","jre"],"draft":null},"fields":{"slug":"/what-i-listen/2022-01-25-jordan-peterson-jre"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3675711862"]}
