Here I'm trying to add some interesting (imo) links with a small comment about it. Different topics and no structure at all.

* [JVM Serializers](https://github.com/eishay/jvm-serializers).
A good big article/research about serialization libraries for JVM.
* [15 Fundamental Laws of Software Development](http://www.exceptionnotfound.net/fundamental-laws-of-software-development/).
Good summary about well-known "Laws".
* [How an internet mapping glitch turned a random Kansas farm into a digital hell](http://fusion.net/story/287592/internet-mapping-glitch-kansas-farm).
"Funny" how developers decisions and technological ignorance could make
harder a life of innocent people.
* [JMock v. Mockito, but not to the death](http://blog.thecodewhisperer.com/2010/10/05/jmock-v-mockito-but-not-to-the-death/).
Simple explaination of JMock and Mockito paradigms.
* [Why I Quit my Dream Job at Ubisoft](http://gingearstudio.com/why-i-quit-my-dream-job-at-ubisoft).
High-end gamedev. Senior developer view.
* [The End of the Internet Dream](https://medium.com/backchannel/the-end-of-the-internet-dream-ba060b17da61).
A sad story about Internet's future.
* [Fuck the Cloud](http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/1717).
Interesting thoughts about clouds and it's place in our lives.
* [What I tell all new programmers](http://josephg.com/blog/what-i-tell-all-new-programmers/).
What is to be a software developer :)
* [Closing a door](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10331891).
A good entry point to the discussion about politeness. Particularly in Linux Kernel.
* [GitHub: Scaling on Ruby, with a nomadic tech team](https://medium.com/s-c-a-l-e/github-scaling-on-ruby-with-a-nomadic-tech-team-4db562b96dcd).
Interesting details about GitHub stack and infrastructure. A good point that
it's better to stick to a certain technology stack (language set) than trying
to use everything new. And also a good point on focusing on a main business
(scaling and presentation git) and took everything else from the outside.
* [The Neophyte's Guide to Scala](http://danielwestheide.com/scala/neophytes.html).
Some explainations about how things works in Scala.
* [Five Health Benefits of Standing Desks](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/five-health-benefits-standing-desks-180950259/?no-ist).
Stand-up software development justification.
* [Please stop calling databases CP or AP](http://martin.kleppmann.com/2015/05/11/please-stop-calling-databases-cp-or-ap.html).
A good thoughts about CAP theorem by Martin Kleppmann. What C, A and P exactly mean.
