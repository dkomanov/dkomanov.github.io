This is an amazing conversation, because Liv is very into objectivity, [LessWrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LessWrong) kind of rationality. And it's a fresh view on the world's challenges and issues.

* [Moloch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moloch) ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fifVuhgvQQ8)) is a very interesting concept, which describes a lose-lose situation in Game Theory:
  * Instagram filters make photo look better, once it introduced, everyone are forced to use it, because without it you don't look as nice. The baseline changes for everyone.
  * If someone on a stadium stands up to see better, everyone behind is forced to stand up to return to the same status as before in terms of view, but all standing.
  * It's hard to tell if changes are possible from within a system under Moloch.
* Existential risk
  * Future pandemic prevention budget shrunk from $60B to $2B in US.
  * Scientific community is very naive.
  * [DEEP VZN](https://www.usaid.gov/news-information/press-releases/oct-5-2021-usaid-announces-new-125-million-project-detect-unknown-viruses) project (very much against it) that aspires to find all potentially bad pathogens on Earth, study it, create a global database of its genomes and put it to Internet (sic!)
  * [Radical honesty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_honesty) would be nice to have from the officials who screwed up and lied to the public -- to start restoring public's trust in institutions.
* AI race is a problem, because there's no way of ensuring safety. However, the engineers working on it mostly aware and cognizant about the risks.
