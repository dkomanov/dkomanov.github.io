* Introduced benchmark for [Circe](https://github.com/circe/circe) library.
* Downgrade versions (because using bazel rules): scrooge&nbsp;(4.6.0).
* Upgrade versions of libraries: scala-library&nbsp;(2.11.8), jackson&nbsp;(2.9.1), protobuf&nbsp;(3.4.0),
  scalapb&nbsp;(0.6.5), boopickle&nbsp;(1.2.5), chill&nbsp;(0.9.2).
* Fixed issue with Chill by cloning input array (therefore it's time of Chill + array clone).
