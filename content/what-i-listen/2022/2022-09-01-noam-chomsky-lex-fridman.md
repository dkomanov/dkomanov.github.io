- Putin didn't change his behavior, he was consistent in his "dislike" of NATO's expansion. And it appears to be the main reason for the invasion.
- The responsibility for the war is on Russia.
- The threat of the nuclear war is real, and people should be aware of it.
- The reason why countries don't follow USA with the support of Ukraine, is because they know that US doesn't care about Ukraine itself...
- Harsh critique of Republican Party as they behave not as a political institution but as a group that just want power (I'm wondering how it's not the same for Democrats?)
- If USA doesn't take the leadership in avoiding incoming crisises, Humanity is doomed.
