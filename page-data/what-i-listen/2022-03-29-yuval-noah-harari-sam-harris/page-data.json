Hard to choose what to put in notes and what not.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Again, on the point for <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2022/02/09/yuval-noah-harari-argues-that-whats-at-stake-in-ukraine-is-the-direction-of-human-history\">going back to the jungle</a>: the war affects everybody, not only Russia and Ukraine. For example, other countries increase their military budgets, obviously, money are taken from other, more important fields like health care or education.</li>\n<li>Another point about the Jungle is Nuclear Weapon. The question is raised again - it’s obvious that when you have nukes, you aren’t going to be invaded by NATO, for example. And with more “red buttons” increases the probability of someone pressing the button.</li>\n<li>It’s very important not to put all dictatorship in the same basket, to not force a unite between them. Like, it’s much better for the world to be ok with neutral China then to ostracize it.</li>\n<li>China haven’t engaged in military actions since 1979. This is good. And it helps to make Russia lose.\n<blockquote>\n<p>At this moment in history if somebody is thinking in terms of new Cold War or new World War, this is not the right moment for China and Russia to raise the flag: Who is joining us. Maybe who was too impatient - Putin. In 5 years, in 10 years it could have been completely different situation both because the West could have been self destructed by then and because the global position would’ve changed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>A very interesting question was asked about: in the world of distrust, shouldn’t we move to institutions that rely less on trust. And example is Bitcoin. And the answer is good, that it’s the opposite. When you rely on trust, you have more opportunities. Like being able to block money of Russia, because there is a consensus that it’s a right thing to do (it’s tricky, because one may argue that in Bitcoin it’s also possible to fork, but trust is indeed more important IMO).</li>\n<li>It’s very counter-productive to tie together a regime change and the end of war.</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"date":"2022-03-29T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Defending the Global Order #276.
