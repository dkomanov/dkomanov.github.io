- _2022-08-15_ [Scale By The Bay 2019: Norman Maurer, Netty 5: Lessons Learned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvYqSz_BgUM).
  A nice talk about Netty 5.0, what was improved since v4.1, how it was improved, what neat tricks are used and so on. I stumbled upon this talk from the comment on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/n2j9pw/comment/gwlfnu6/) about how "misguided" netty people about security. What can I say - if you need performance, you bypass some stuff and draw security perimeter outside.
