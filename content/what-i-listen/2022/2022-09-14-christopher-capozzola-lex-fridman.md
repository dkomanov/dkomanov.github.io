In general it was a nice conversation about war and current politics.

* First World War started long before 1914: imperialism had some unsolvable issues, and empires started to militarize long before the War started.
* The biggest problem (and take away) from WWI is that you can't solve issues with war. In case of WWI there was a clear winner, but the issues weren't resolved which didn't help in avoiding WWII.
* US election is not rigged. Or at least not as much as people think.
  * There is clearly an incentive for that. But that incentive is more of an indicator of partisan division.
  * Partisan division is much more important issue. But it's not something new, it happened many times before. The question is how to get out of it.
* Platforming of Putin or Donald Trump. On one hand division and evilness, on the other hand their perspectives and understanding what's going on. Giving perspective as an opposite of deplatforming to avoid resentment of the supporters.
* For direct democracy we don't need to go to Mars. Why not starting making small changes in this direction here and now? (I AGREE)
* I like his "advice to young":
  > History teaches that you should be more optimistic than your current surroundings suggest... It would be very easy to think that there is nothing I can do about this politics, there is nothing I can say to this person on the other side of the aisle, there is nothing I can do about the planet, etc. And just sort of give up. And the history teaches that we don't who the winners and losers are in a long run, but we know that the people who give up are always the losers.

Interestingly enough, Lex speaks more and more in each podcast.
