Hi! My name is [Dmitry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitry), but friends call me Mitya.

I was born in Moscow, Russia. I lived there for 30 year, and in 2014 I decided to
move to Israel.

Got Master Degree in [BMSTU](http://www.bmstu.ru/en/). I'm a Software Developer,
now I mostly use Scala, but previously wrote a lot in C++, Java and C#. I'm trying
to share the knowledge as much as I can, this is why I write blog posts from time
to time (when I actually have some time).

In Moscow I worked at [Yandex](https://www.yandex.com/) for 4 years, in Israel
I work in [Wix](https://www.wix.com/).
