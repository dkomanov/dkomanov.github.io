My blog [post]({% link _posts/2015-09-13-testing-asynchronous-code.md %}) was [published](https://www.wix.engineering/single-post/testing-asynchronous-code) in a [Wix Engineering Blog](https://www.wix.engineering/). It was hugely edited before with the real editor. It's funny to find out that your English is worse than you thought before :) But I don't upset, on the contrary -- it's a good way to improve yourself.

Hopefully, I will have enough time to continue my writing exercises.
