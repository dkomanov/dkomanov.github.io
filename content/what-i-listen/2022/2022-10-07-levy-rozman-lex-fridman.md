Generally, Lex is all over in this podcast, and he is very dark sometimes. Feels like a lot of stuff is unspoken (unreleased stuff from Ukraine), but this stuff isn't in Levy's zone of interests.

* Levy's story about [Indonesia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvr9pSOsowU) incident is... interesting.
* Segment on death is amazing. Lex Fridman actually thought this through :)
