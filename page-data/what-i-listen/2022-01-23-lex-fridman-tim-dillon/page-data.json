Most very busy people comes through their relatives that fans of the podcast.\n<blockquote>\n<p>House ownership people often use as an excuse to get complacent, to limit yourself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>Crypto is maybe a revolution to a monetary system (will see).</li>\n<li>About Putin… I have very mixed feelings when I hear Lex talking about modern Russia and Putin. On one hand, it’s interesting to hear his take. But then, as a highly opposing person to a Putin/Putin’s regime, it’s also hard to hear that he almost entirely disregards all the crazy stuff about what’s happening in Russia today. I guess, it’s just my bias, I am a bit more in the topic. And it’s also possible, that his attitude is more effective, as he doesn’t see it as a ”<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Putinism\">bloody regime</a>“.</li>\n<li>About Epstein and ties with intelligence agencies (Mossad, CIA etc). Lex (I agree!!!):</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So, this is a view of the world with the intelligence organizations is ultra competent… my view is they are not ultra complex, they’re exceptionally well funded… but they are not the A-students of the world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Lex is good. And what I liked about this podcast - Tim Dillon asks such questions, that you wouldn’t hear it from anyone else (and wouldn’t ask yourself), which makes it unique and extra interesting.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2022-01-23T00:00:00.000Z","title":"#282 - Lex Fridman | The Tim Dillon Show","podcastDate":"2022-01-04T00:00:00.000Z","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVZehtgi3W0","teaser":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fixed","backgroundColor":"#181818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/a71c57996c83d8c7425e5d31afa96ab3/3f9e2/2022-01-23-lex-fridman-tim-dillon.jpg","srcSet":"/static/a71c57996c83d8c7425e5d31afa96ab3/3f9e2/2022-01-23-lex-fridman-tim-dillon.jpg 100w,\n/static/a71c57996c83d8c7425e5d31afa96ab3/1bf32/2022-01-23-lex-fridman-tim-dillon.jpg 200w","sizes":"100px"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/a71c57996c83d8c7425e5d31afa96ab3/b2036/2022-01-23-lex-fridman-tim-dillon.webp 100w,\n/static/a71c57996c83d8c7425e5d31afa96ab3/b6124/2022-01-23-lex-fridman-tim-dillon.webp 200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100px"}]},"width":100,"height":56}}},"tags":["lex fridman","tim dillon"],"draft":null},"fields":{"slug":"/what-i-listen/2022-01-23-lex-fridman-tim-dillon"}}}},
