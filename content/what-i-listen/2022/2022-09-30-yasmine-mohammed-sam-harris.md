* (Some?) Liberals in West love to protect wearing burka/whatever as "cultural" thing, ignoring oppression completely.
* A [TED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hj9oB4zpHww) talk by Sam Harris in which he talks about ability to determine morals without referring to religion.
* Even in Western countries (Canada) it's very hard to escape home abuse related to a religion (even canadian judge said something like "it's ok because you're coming from this culture"). Imagine how hard it's to escape in less developed countries (by chance I read [Russian story](https://cherta.media/story/istoriya-devushki-iz-dagestana-sbezhavshej-ot-semi-k-svobode/) about such escape yesterday).
* Her husband (forced marriage by her mom) appeared to be Al-Qaeda member...
* Sam Harris [arguments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vln9D81eO60) with Ben Affleck triggered her to speak out, because all her Facebook friends kind of praise Ben Affleck and condemned "racist Sam Harris".
* Amazing comparison between [Megan Phelps-Roper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megan_Phelps-Roper) story (escaping cult founded by a white man) and Yasmine's: left responded differently. Because it's easy to condemn white-people wrongdoing and somehow it's hard to do so for "another culture" (Ben Affleck's case).
