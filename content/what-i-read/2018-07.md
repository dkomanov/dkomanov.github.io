* _2018-07-05_ [Rules of optimization](http://www.humus.name/index.php?page=News&ID=383).
Performance as a process and culture from the perspective of game developer. I'm under impression,
that performance really matters in gamedev and in giant internet companies like Google/Facebook/Yandex.
Which is sad.
* _2018-07-19_ [Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Recode Decode](https://www.recode.net/2018/7/18/17575158/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-interview-full-transcript-kara-swisher).
Very intense interview of Mark Zuckerberg. I don't really like interviewer approach, when she explicitly clear about her disapproval, but maybe it's the thing in the specific podcast. Some of criticism is rightful, because we know that Facebook doesn't always hear the feedback, but some of accusations about election interference sound to me like victim blaming (yes, fb is a victim too -- those events force fb to do extra thing, that are required only for them).
* _2018-07-25_ [Breaking the Dark Net: Why the Police Share Abuse Pics to Save Children](https://www.vg.no/spesial/2017/undercover-darkweb/?lang=en)
Interesting long-read about how the police found admins of the forum with abusive content, took over it and how journalists discovered it.
