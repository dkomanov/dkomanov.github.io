If some people require to take them with a grain of salt, I don't know how much more you need to take when you listen to an intelligence officer talking. OMG, the amount of dishonesty and deceit I had to endure during this episode... And the most annoying thing is that it's done in a manner, when you're given some real data with WTF conclusions or something that only seems reasonable conclusion. Anyway, this is the general mood.

- On Russia vs Ukraine: on the one hand it's a good to have "sober" and "pessimistic" take on something that you care deeply about. Maybe I'm biased, but my immediate thought was like: as always, "military"/whatever downplay successes to acquire more budget. But again, the problems of Ukraine in a short/long term are laid out somewhat correctly.
- Undercover disguises part was actually good.
- Privacy part made me really angry. "NSA doesn't care if you don't pay taxes" - OMG, you really want anyone to believe that people who work at NSA care about people and security? MLK [example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr.#State_surveillance_and_coercion) is not good enough? Any collected data will be used against you if necessary. And Lex didn't push back enough, which is sad.
- And the way he depicts Snowden (factually incorrect) says it all: he is biased af.

Still, sometimes it's good to hear from the "other side".
