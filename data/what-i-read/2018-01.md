It's just a very cool story about speed of light and software engineering :)

Alpha-version of [Conduit](https://conduit.io/), a service mesh (like Envoy). What is funny, it's done by company that developed [Linkerd](https://linkerd.io/) (another service mesh). Apparently, JVM overhead is too big for a service mesh.

A good introduction to [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/). Must be written in Rust, but at least not in node.js :-P

Apology for not using fat clients and libraries. I have only one objection, that it's possible in an organization to actually use libraries for performance reasons, but there must be tooling around it to be able to deploy fast all services that depends on a library. But it's also hard :)
