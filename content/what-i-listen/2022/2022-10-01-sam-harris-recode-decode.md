* Funny how Sam Harris admits that he is on a fringe towards Trump :)
* White supremacy is less dangerous than Islam mostly due to scale (my reading): too many people believe certain "bad" behavior is a norm.
* A tech dilemma is very complicated: whether to censor or not censor at all... The idea of bringing less anonymity is interesting. Elon Musk talked recently about it as well: having an option to buy a badge which will indicate that you're a human, not bot. And also it gives information to Twitter - who are you.
* I read some comments disliking the interviewer. This interviewer is not "my kind", but still legitimate and edgy. I wish her to go more into debate instead of jumping between topics.
