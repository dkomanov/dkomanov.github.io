It was an interesting interview (not debate), I want to point out 2 things:
- Cultural war has to end.
- Very much related, on the immigration policy debate:
  - There is a moral obligation to accept refugees from the neighboring countries (even though the definition for refugee might be a bit murky).
  - Otherwise, country should have a right to define its policy towards immigrants. And the democratic debate should be between 2 positions (more tolerant/accepting vs more conservative) as between 2 legitimate positions, without weaponization, without calling the opposite side "an evil".
