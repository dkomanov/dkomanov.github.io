- How Lex gets guest? Most very busy people comes through their relatives that fans of the podcast.
  > House ownership people often use as an excuse to get complacent, to limit yourself.
- Crypto is maybe a revolution to a monetary system (will see).
- About Putin... I have very mixed feelings when I hear Lex talking about modern Russia and Putin. On one hand, it's interesting to hear his take. But then, as a highly opposing person to a Putin/Putin's regime, it's also hard to hear that he almost entirely disregards all the crazy stuff about what's happening in Russia today. I guess, it's just my bias, I am a bit more in the topic. And it's also possible, that his attitude is more effective, as he doesn't see it as a "[bloody regime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Putinism)".
- About Epstein and ties with intelligence agencies (Mossad, CIA etc). Lex (I agree!!!):
> So, this is a view of the world with the intelligence organizations is ultra competent... my view is they are not ultra complex, they're exceptionally well funded... but they are not the A-students of the world.

Lex is good. And what I liked about this podcast - Tim Dillon asks such questions, that you wouldn't hear it from anyone else (and wouldn't ask yourself), which makes it unique and extra interesting.
