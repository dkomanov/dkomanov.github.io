Yet another interview with Elon (better than TED, btw). I want to point out major ideas:

- Nuclear is very important to have. At least in a transitioning phase until there will be enough battery capacity (for a very long time).
- (why Elon doesn't work on longevity?) People rarely change their minds. So, death is a natural way of advancement. Also Louis CK had a routine in his latest [special](https://louisck.com/collections/sorry) about the same. Wondering if it's a coincidence.
- Better to do something useful then do charity.
- World isn't overpopulated. World needs more people, but the progression is bad.
