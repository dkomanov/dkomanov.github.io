- I really like Mark Normand, his humor, his comedy.
- Mark Normand grew up in New Orleans. Upbringing was tough (bullies, crime etc.). Some [stories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3g1hJj6iGY) from JRE.
- Lex asked about the process of writing a joke, about bombing, improvement etc. More or less generic stuff, but still.
- Interesting thoughts about starting out: you have to think about your appearance a lot, how people perceive you may affect which jokes you'll be able to tell (otherwise people may dismiss your jokes, because it won't feel natural coming from you.)
> Lex: It's not actually the fastest sperm... I think a lot of this timing and luck, what it seems like. There's actual papers on this and I've actually been reading them :)
- Lex asked few rapid random questions. Actually, very interesting ones. Like:
> What small act of kindness were you once shown that you'll never forget?
- Another question about how to live life:
> I think the key to life is living that fucking crazy awesome badass and also having some... meaning and a little bit of... what's the word? Just not killing yourself! 
- From the stolen bike story from the childhood -- it's very important and powerful to just have "Someone on your side", it means a lot for a child (not only).
