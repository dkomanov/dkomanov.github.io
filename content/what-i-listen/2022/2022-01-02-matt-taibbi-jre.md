This is the first episode when I decided to write down my thought on. So, not from the beginning. Just a pilot review :)

* Facinating experience of Matt in Russia. He knows Soviet/early-Russian stuff how it works there. Kudos!
* A lot of talks about how media used to operate (integrity, source verification) versus today. Summarized as dig vs take. Like!
> The current generation has been raised on a different model that's based on being quick, getting a couple of quotes, putting something up fast, and it's brief. It's more of a take than it's a dig...
* First time I heard of [Bail Reform](https://www.aclu.org/issues/smart-justice/bail-reform). That it's very common to set bail "just a little bit" higher that the person can afford. "wink-wink" between prosecutor and judge. OMG.
